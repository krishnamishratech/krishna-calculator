🎉 Exciting News! 🎉

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed my second task for the internship! 🚀📝

I've created a calculator app capable of performing basic math operations, showcasing my growing skills in web development. 💻🔢 It's been an incredible learning journey, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project.
